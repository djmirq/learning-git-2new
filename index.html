		<h4>Tekst piosenki:</h4>
		<br /> I found a love for me
		<br /> Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
		<br /> I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
		<br /> I never knew you were
		<br /> The someone waiting for me
		<br /> 'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
		<br /> Not knowing what it was
		<br /> I will not give you up this time
		<br /> But darling, just kiss me slow,
		<br /> Your heart is all I own
		<br /> And in your eyes, you're holding mine
 
		<br />
		<br /> Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
		<br /> With you between my arms
		<br /> Barefoot on the grass, listening
		<br /> To our favourite song
		<br /> When you said you looked a mess,
		<br /> I whispered underneath my breath
		<br /> But you heard it, darling,
		<br /> You look perfect tonight
		<br />
