		<h4>Tekst piosenki:</h4>
		<br /> I found a love for me
		<br /> Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
		<br /> I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
		<br /> I never knew you were
		<br /> The someone waiting for me
		<br /> 'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
		<br /> Not knowing what it was
		<br /> I will not give you up this time
		<br /> But darling, just kiss me slow,
		<br /> Your heart is all I own
		<br /> And in your eyes, you're holding mine
		<br />
		<br /> Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
		<br /> With you between my arms
		<br /> Barefoot on the grass, listening
		<br /> To our favourite song
		<br /> When you said you looked a mess,
		<br /> I whispered underneath my breath
		<br /> But you heard it, darling,
		<br /> You look perfect tonight
		<br />
		<br /> Well I found a woman,
		<br /> Stronger than anyone I know
		<br /> She shares my dreams, I hope
		<br /> That someday I'll share her home
		<br /> I found a love, to carry more
		<br /> Than just my secrets
		<br /> To carry love, to carry children
		<br /> Of our own
		<br />
		<br /> We are still kids, but
		<br /> We're so in love
		<br /> Fighting against all odds
		<br /> I know we'll be alright this time
		<br /> Darling, just hold my hand
		<br /> Be my girl, I'll be your man
		<br /> I see my future in your eyes
		<br />
		<br /> Baby, I'm dancing in the dark,
		<br /> With you between my arms
		<br /> Barefoot on the grass, listening
		<br /> To our favourite song
		<br /> When I saw you in that dress,
		<br /> Looking so beautiful
		<br /> I don't deserve this, darling,
		<br /> You look perfect tonight
		<br />
		<br /> Baby, I'm dancing in the dark,
		<br /> With you between my arms
		<br /> Barefoot on the grass,
		<br /> Listening to our favourite song
		<br /> I have faith in what I see
		<br /> Now I know I have met an angel
		<br /> In person, and she looks perfect
		<br /> I don't deserve this
		<br /> You look perfect tonight
